# libcohost

A C / C++ library for interacting with cohost.org

Currently it allows you to login with a valid email and password. You can also login on subsequent attempts using a cookie saved from the previous session.

Valid commandline arguments for the test applications:

```
Set email:
-e <email>

Set password:
-p <password>

File to load cookies from:
-l <filename>

File to save cookies to:
-s <filename>
```

Requires libcurl, libcJSON and libnettle.

## Building

To build for a Linux target, you can enter a series of commands like the following:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JaycieErysdren/libcohost
cd libcohost
mkdir cmake-build-amd64
cd cmake-build-amd64
cmake ..
make
```

To build for a Windows target from Linux, you can enter a series of commands like the following:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JaycieErysdren/libcohost
cd libcohost
mkdir cmake-build-win64
cd cmake-build-win64
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake ..
make
```

To build for a DOS target from Linux, you can enter a series of commands like the following:

(Note: this will probably not work)

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JaycieErysdren/libcohost
cd libcohost
mkdir cmake-build-dos32
cd cmake-build-dos32
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/i586-pc-msdosdjgpp.cmake ..
make
```
